Random Number Generator

This Python code allows users to set a range and generate a random number within that range, as well as generate an even or odd number within the same range based on user choice. The program prompts the user to enter the starting and ending values of the range, then prompts the user to choose whether they want an odd or even number. The program uses the random.choice() function to generate a random even or odd number from the list of candidate numbers and prints the generated number.
